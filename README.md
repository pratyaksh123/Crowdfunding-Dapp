### What?

We-fund is a decentralized crowdfunding application built on ethereum, this was made during a blockchain-based hackathon "EthOdyssey". Its like a decentralized version of kickstarter, using this dapp ( decentralized app ) anyone can create a crowdfunding project by setting a goal, title, and duration till the project remains active. If the goal is successfully reached by the deadline then the funds automatically get transferred to the project creator else the funds are automatically refunded back to the contributors. This logic is implemented using [Smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) and everything is done without the involvement of a third party.

### Why?

#### Decentralized crowdfunding has many benefits over the traditional centralized crowdfunding apps including -

- The biggest benefit of decentralized crowdfunding is the transparency it brings to the table. As there are no intermediaries involved, there is a clear money trail to follow.

- Another benefit to explore is the cost-efficiency of decentralized crowdfunding. As no intermediaries are involved, there is a significant reduction in costs to organize the sale and collect money afterward.

- Global availability ( 24/7 ), as it is a Dapp that runs on the ethereum blockchain which is highly secured by the large number of nodes securing the network.
